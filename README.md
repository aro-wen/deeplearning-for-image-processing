## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.10.11
* Git
* Visual Studio Code
* Pip (comes with Python)
* Internet connection (for installing packages)

---

## 🐍 Installing Python 3.10.11

1. Download Python 3.10.11 from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/)
2. During installation:

   * Check "Add Python to PATH"
   * You can optionally choose "Customize Installation"
3. Confirm installation:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

---

## 🖥️ Setting Up VS Code for Python and Jupyter

1. Install Visual Studio Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. In VS Code, go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Install:

   * Python (by Microsoft)
   * Jupyter (by Microsoft)

## ⬇️ Cloning the Repository

In your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Replace with your actual repo URL.

---

## 🌱 Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment

### On Windows:

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### On macOS/Linux:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should now see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

---

## 📚 Installing Dependencies

With the `venv` activated, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
